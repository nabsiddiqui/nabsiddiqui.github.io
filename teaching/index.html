My research on the sociocultural implications of data science and cultural objects gives me a unique perspective on the classroom as a transformative space that can significantly enhance student experiences. As a Pakistani American raised in Mississippi, I have witnessed and been impacted by the gaps that exist in information access and how issues of representation can create barriers that perpetuate social injustices. This has compelled me to orient my approach toward creating a truly inclusive learning environment. I actively engage students through diverse materials and innovative pedagogical methods, effectively bridging the gap between theoretical concepts and their practical applications while catering to various learning modalities.</p><p>Two essential frameworks that guide course design and educational outcomes are central to my teaching philosophy: backward design and Transparency in Teaching and Learning . Unlike traditional curriculum structures, backward design places an emphasis on clear learning objectives and assessments. My initial course development involves three straightforward yet impactful steps. First, I identify desired learning outcomes aligned with the Revised Bloom&rsquo;s Taxonomy, ensuring students acquire the knowledge necessary for deep understanding. Next, I develop diverse assessment methods that encourage students&rsquo; analytical skills and promote understanding over memorization. Lastly, I seek out materials that empower students to connect and apply their learning across disciplines in ways they believe are relevant and engaging. Such an approach resonates particularly well in an interdisciplinary context, allowing students to integrate knowledge from different fields.</p><p>In tandem with backward design, I leverage the TILT framework to clarify each assignment&rsquo;s purpose, task, and criteria. This research-based model enhances students&rsquo; understanding of expectations and has been shown to be particularly beneficial for historically underrepresented groups. By embedding these principles into my assignments, all learners gain equitable access to success and pathways that encourage ownership over their learning.</p><p>In my courses, I emphasize experiential learning through hands-on activities to actualize my teaching philosophy. In courses like &ldquo;Digital Media Analytics,&rdquo; students cultivate practical skills by creating neural networks to explore racial bias, utilizing GIS software to analyze the COVID-19 pandemic and the historical context of slavery, and engaging in network analysis of political organizations. Similarly, in &ldquo;The Information Age in America,&rdquo; I empower students to explore embodiment through virtual reality, analyze human-computer interactions with 3D motion and gesture controllers, and deepen their understanding of fan cultures through hacking Super Nintendo cartridges. By integrating thematic discussions on intersectionality, I recognize and value the diverse identities in the classroom, aiming to foster an inclusive academic community.</p><p>I am proud that my commitment to pedagogy has resulted in consistently high student evaluations across diverse course offerings. Over the past four years, I have maintained an average rating above 4.0 on a five-point scale, with particularly strong scores in course organization and instructional clarity. Students consistently praise my courses for their accessibility, clear learning objectives, and my ability to break down complex concepts into manageable components. In written feedback, students frequently highlight my willingness to provide additional support through one-on-one consultations, detailed feedback, and flexible office hours that accommodate their busy schedules.</p><p>Building on this successful teaching approach, I have extended my impact beyond my own classroom. As Director of the Center for Teaching and Learning at Susquehanna University, I have developed faculty workshops focusing on topics as wide-ranging as neurodiversity, intersectionality, gender sensitivity, and cultural competency. In addition, I worked with members throughout the university to enhance our students&rsquo; educational experiences. These initiatives have empowered my colleagues to create more inclusive syllabi and foster an engaging academic environment. The 50% increase in faculty engagement with the CTL during my tenure underscores my ability to champion best practices in teaching and drive meaningful change.</p><p>In conclusion, my teaching philosophy reflects a commitment to fostering an inclusive environment that prioritizes student engagement and interdisciplinary collaboration. As a dedicated educator and leader, I lead with a vision of preparing students for success in an increasingly diverse and interconnected world.</p></div></main><script>document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",function(){const t=document.querySelector(".hamburger-menu"),e=document.querySelector(".mobile-menu-overlay"),n=document.body;if(t&&e){t.addEventListener("click",function(){t.classList.toggle("active"),e.classList.toggle("active"),n.style.overflow=e.classList.contains("active")?"hidden":""});const s=document.querySelectorAll(".mobile-nav a");s.forEach(s=>{s.addEventListener("click",function(){t.classList.remove("active"),e.classList.remove("active"),n.style.overflow=""})}),e.addEventListener("click",function(s){s.target===e&&(t.classList.remove("active"),e.classList.remove("active"),n.style.overflow="")})}})</script></body></html>
