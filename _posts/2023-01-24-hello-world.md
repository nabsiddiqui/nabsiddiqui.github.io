While this site may currently look like it is spam, I am in the process of changing the website from WordPress to Jekyll and hosting it on GitHub. I find WordPress significantly easier to use than Jekyll. Still, I believe that Jekyll will provide a better experience for the data science and cultural analytics work I plan to share on this site. With WordPress, when you have a lot of image embeddings or interactive visualizations, the site can become slow to load and navigate. Jekyll, on the other hand, generates static pages that load quickly and efficiently. Additionally, hosting the site on GitHub allows for version control and easy collaboration with others.

Please bear with me as I work through this transition. I appreciate your patience and understanding.
