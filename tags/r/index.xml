This is the first book that brings together the many ways tidy data principles can be used across cultural analytics workflows. I&amp;rsquo;m grateful to everyone who has expressed interest in this project and supported its development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what exactly is &lt;em&gt;Cultural Analytics in R&lt;/em&gt;? Well, it&amp;rsquo;s my attempt to fill a gap I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about for yearsâ€”how do we get humanities folks comfortable with computational methods without scaring them away with too much technical jargon? As historian Roy Rosenzweig pointed out way back in 2003, we&amp;rsquo;ve moved from &amp;ldquo;a culture of scarcity to a culture of abundance&amp;rdquo; in our digital world. Suddenly, we have access to massive archives of cultural data, but most humanities scholars weren&amp;rsquo;t really trained to handle that scale of information.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
