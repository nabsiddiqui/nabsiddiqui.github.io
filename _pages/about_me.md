I am an Assistant Professor of Digital Media in Susquehanna Universityâ€™s Communications Department. I also serve as Director for our Center for Teaching and Learning. I specialize in data science, cultural analytics, the digital humanities, the history of information science, communication, new media rhetoric, and statistics. My research has appeared in numerous academic journals, such as the _Programming Historian, Digital Humanities Quarterly, The International Journal of Digital Humanities, and The Journal of Open Humanities Data._ I have a range of interests, and this blog is an attempt to share my thoughts on a variety of topics along with my various data science and digital media projects.
