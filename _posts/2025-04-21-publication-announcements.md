Two quick publication announcements!

First, I'm thrilled to announce that I have a new article published over on the official [Topps Ripped blog](https://ripped.topps.com/)!

Anyone who knows me knows I've been a lifelong professional wrestling fan. It's a passion that goes back to when I was a kid. So, getting the chance to combine that interest with writing about cultural history and trading cards was a fun opportunity. The article, "[1987 Topps WWE WrestleMania Cards: History & Culture](https://ripped.topps.com/1987-topps-wwe-wrestlemania-cards-history-culture/)", takes a deep dive into the iconic card set released around the time of the legendary WrestleMania III. I explore the design choices, the larger-than-life wrestlers featured, and the cultural significance of these cards during a pivotal boom period for WWE (then WWF).

Second, I'm excited to share that my new article, "[Visualizing Urban Demographic Data with R and ggplot2](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/urban-demographic-data-r-ggplot2)", is now live on *The Programming Historian*! 

This lesson, which I wrote with Igor Sosa Mayor walks through the process of using R, specifically the `tidyverse` and `ggplot2` packages, to create visualizations of historical urban demographic data. There is a particular focus on understanding the Grammar of Graphics and how to effectively communicate data insights through visual means.

It's been a busy period, and I'm really pleased to have both of these pieces out in the world. Check them out if you're interested!
