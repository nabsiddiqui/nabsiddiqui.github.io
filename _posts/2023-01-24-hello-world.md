While this site may currently look like it is spam, I am in the process of changing the website from WordPress to Jekyll and hosting it on GitHub. I find WordPress significantly easier to use than Jekyll, but I think the latter provides a better experience for the data science and cultural analytics work I do. 

With WordPress, when you have a lot of image embeddings or interactive visualizations, the site can become slow to load. While I have been [critical of minimal computing](https://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/16/2/000588/000588.html) for its emphasis on "speed" and "longevity," I have to admit that it does allow those who may not have the resources to engage with more dominant, resource-heavy computing environments. 

Please bear with me as I work through this transition. I appreciate your patience and understanding.
