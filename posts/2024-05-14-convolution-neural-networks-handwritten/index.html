Consequently, documents typically require manual tagging and categorization by human archivistsâ€”a time-consuming and labor-intensive process. This issue is compounded by the fact that historical documents often use scripts or writing styles unfamiliar to contemporary students. Since <a href=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/10/gen-z-handwriting-teaching-cursive-history/671246/>cursive is rarely taught now</a>, younger generations may need specific training to read certain historical documents. While transformer models show promise in transcribing handwritten text, they require large amounts of labeled training data, which is often unavailable for historical documents. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) offer a promising alternative. By learning visual features directly from handwritten images, CNNs can potentially categorize and tag documents without requiring full transcription.</p><p>To examine this, I looked at the handwritten materials currently being collected by the <a href=https://cwrgm.org/>Mississippi Civil War and Reconstruction Governor&rsquo;s Project</a>, led by <a href=https://www.history.msstate.edu/directory/abc123>Susannah J. Ural</a> at Mississippi State University and <a href=https://lindseyraepeterson.com/>Lindsey R. Paterson</a> at the University of South Dakota. The Mississippi Department of Archives and History has been amassing a vast collection of handwritten letters sent to the state&rsquo;s governors by citizens since 1902. This extensive archive, spanning over a century, contains almost 20,000 letters dating back to 1859. Students have been diligently working on transcribing the letters manually, and while this process is time-consuming, it provides a unique opportunity to test for accuracy.</p><p>When this analysis was conducted, approximately 7,850 documents were available online; the publicly accessible archive has since grown to almost 11,800 documents. The documents span various topics, from personal correspondence to official government communications. As part of the CWRGM project, documents are carefully transcribed and tagged with metadata like date, sender, recipient, and subject matter. Using <a href=https://github.com/YaleDHLab/pix-plot>PixPlot</a>, I created a visual overview of the collection available at the time. PixPlot uses a CNN to extract visual features from each image and then projects those features into a 2D space using UMAP for dimensionality reduction. It then utilizes <a href=https://hdbscan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how_hdbscan_works.html>Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise</a> (HDBSCAN) to identify clusters within the projected space. These clusters can potentially reveal patterns and groupings within the collection not immediately apparent from the metadata alone.</p><p><a href=https://nabeelsiddiqui.net/civil_war_and_reconstruction_governors/>Explore the PixPlot visualization of the CWRGM documents.</a></p><p>By exploring the PixPlot visualization, I noticed several distinct clusters of visually similar documents.</p><h2 id=telegrams-in-cluster-6>Telegrams in Cluster 6</h2><p>One cluster, labeled Cluster 6, contained a significant number of telegrams. The telegrams in this cluster were characterized by their brief, condensed language, and standardized formatting, typically including the date, sender, and recipient information at the top of the document, followed by the message itself.</p><p><img src=/assets/governors_reconstruction/cluster_6_telegrams.png alt="Examples of telegrams found in Cluster 6 of the PixPlot visualization"></p><h2 id=printed-letters-in-cluster-7>Printed Letters in Cluster 7</h2><p>Another visually distinct cluster, labeled Cluster 7, contained a high concentration of printed letters. These letters were likely produced using a typewriter or printing press, evidenced by their uniform typography and layout. The presence of printed letters suggests that not all communications were handwritten and that some individuals or organizations had access to more advanced writing technologies. This cluster also demonstrates the CNN&rsquo;s ability to effectively distinguish between handwritten and printed documents based purely on visual features.</p><p><img src=/assets/governors_reconstruction/cluster_7_printed.png alt="Examples of printed letters found in Cluster 7 of the PixPlot visualization"></p></div></main><script>document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",function(){const t=document.querySelector(".hamburger-menu"),e=document.querySelector(".mobile-menu-overlay"),n=document.body;if(t&&e){t.addEventListener("click",function(){t.classList.toggle("active"),e.classList.toggle("active"),n.style.overflow=e.classList.contains("active")?"hidden":""});const s=document.querySelectorAll(".mobile-nav a");s.forEach(s=>{s.addEventListener("click",function(){t.classList.remove("active"),e.classList.remove("active"),n.style.overflow=""})}),e.addEventListener("click",function(s){s.target===e&&(t.classList.remove("active"),e.classList.remove("active"),n.style.overflow="")})}})</script></body></html>
