      <description>&lt;p&gt;Exciting news: my book &lt;em&gt;Cultural Analytics in R: A Tidy Approach&lt;/em&gt; has just been published by SpringerLink! This is the first book that brings together the many ways tidy data principles can be used across cultural analytics workflows. I&amp;rsquo;m grateful to everyone who has expressed interest in this project and supported its development.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So what exactly is &lt;em&gt;Cultural Analytics in R&lt;/em&gt;? Well, it&amp;rsquo;s my attempt to fill a gap I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about for years—how do we get humanities folks comfortable with computational methods without scaring them away with too much technical jargon? As historian Roy Rosenzweig pointed out way back in 2003, we&amp;rsquo;ve moved from &amp;ldquo;a culture of scarcity to a culture of abundance&amp;rdquo; in our digital world. Suddenly, we have access to massive archives of cultural data, but most humanities scholars weren&amp;rsquo;t really trained to handle that scale of information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
